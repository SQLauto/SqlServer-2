The database in this zip file is the one used in all the Query Store demos.
It's not necessary to download this, you can use your own database and query workload instead, the demo scripts in each module only reference the Query Store views, although they do filter for objects included in this database

If you do use this DB, there are four example queries in the .sql file to generate some Query Store data.
Probably the easiest way to generate some Query Store data to to run each of the queries in a loop using GO <n>
