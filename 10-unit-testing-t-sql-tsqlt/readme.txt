This course is designed for users of Microsoft SQL Server Version 2005 (SP2) and above. 
It is not possible to use Microsoft Azure, as it does not currently support CLR use.
For the demos in this course I am using the Developer edition of SQL Server version 2012.

We will use tSQLt version 1.0.4969.33062 for this course. This can be downloaded from http://tsqlt.org
Using tSQLt will require you to enable CLR on your development SQL server.

I am also using SQL Test version 1.4 to run my tests within SQL Server Management Studio, 
but it is possible to follow this course without this software.
A trial of this software can be downloaded from http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-test/
